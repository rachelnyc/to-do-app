# To-Do List Front End App

This is the front end of a simple To-Do List web application built using React.js. The application allows users to manage their tasks, mark tasks as completed, and search for tasks. The front end communicates with a Node.js back end to perform these actions.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rachelnyc/to-do-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd to-do-app
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the application.

- Check and uncheck tasks to mark them as completed or active.
